In this repository, you will find the Midi remote script needed to use the MPC Studio Mk2 with Ableton. It is a work in progress, but the functionality so far is on par with the MPC software.

My attempts to use this product with other software left me very frustrated. Without the brains of the MPC 2 software, this device on its own is useless. It sends out midi data, but not in a way that is remotely usable. Through sending and observing MIDI data to and from the device, I have discovered that there is no logic on the device to perform any of it's functions, it is all controlled by the software(MPC 2) through MIDI. That means if I can figure out what MIDI messages, I can program the device with other software. This script is the results of me doing just that. I have figured out every element of the MPC Studio Mk2 except the LCD display. *Any help is appreciated*. 

Enjoy!
