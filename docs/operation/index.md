# General overview
{{ page.path }}
There are 3 main sections of the MPC Studio Mk2 in the context of Ableton Live:
* Pads and the buttons on the left
  * These control multiple things about the session and allow note input. More info in the [Pads section](pads/)
* The buttons to the right, including the jog wheel
  * These mostly do what they say, with a few exceptions. More info in the [Buttons section](buttons/)
* The Touch Strip and buttons **Touch Strip** and **Note Repeat**.
  * These allow controlling some track parameters, provide visual feedback and allow repeated, tempo synchronized note entry. More info in the [Touch Strip section](touchstrip/)

The last section in this page is a single page, easily referencable [Cheat Sheet](cheatsheet/).

Printable PDFs and Diagrams will come soon.
