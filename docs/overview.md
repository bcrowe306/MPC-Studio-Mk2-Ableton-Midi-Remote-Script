# Overview

This script enables functionality for the MPC Studio Mk2 with Ableton live. I will not work the way it was intended for any of the other MPC products. Future versions could account for other hardware versions of the MPC line, but for now, it is assumed you are using Akai's MPC Studio Mk2.

Listed below are some prerequisites for this script:

* Akai MPC Studio Mk2
* Ableton Live:
    * v10.1+
    * v11.x+

Please note that this script is in no way supported by Akai or Ableton. I did reach out to the both companies for any documentation, but they both declined in various ways.
